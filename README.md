# Rossmann Sales Forecasting and Business Strategy Optimization
# **Project Overview**

This project analyzes sales data from Rossman stores to identify trends and influencing factors. Using machine learning and statistical methods, the analysis aims to provide actionable insights for improving sales and customer engagement.

**Project Aim**

The goal of this project is to analyze the sales patterns of Rossman stores, understand the factors influencing sales, and build a predictive model to forecast future sales. The insights will assist Rossman in optimizing campaigns, inventory management, and overall sales strategies.

# **Techniques Used**

Data Preparation: Cleaned and preprocessed data, handling missing values and creating features to capture trends and campaign effects.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized trends, seasonal patterns, and relationships using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

**Time Series Analysis**: Decomposed sales data into trend, seasonal, and residual components to uncover temporal dynamics.

Machine Learning: Developed and evaluated a Random Forest Regressor to forecast sales, optimizing for accuracy.

Statistical Methods: Conducted hypothesis testing and applied empirical distribution analysis to study sales patterns.

**Key Findings and Outcomes**

Corporate campaigns significantly increased sales, especially in the last quarter of the year.

Sales were higher in summer and winter months, with peaks during public holidays.

Stores near competitors performed better when running frequent campaigns, particularly those established after 1999.

Type B products showed the highest sales volume, especially on weekdays.

There has been an increase in per-customer sales over the years.

**Business Recommendations**

Campaign Strategy: Prioritize corporate campaigns during high-sales periods (e.g., winter holidays) and increase store-specific campaigns near competitor locations to gain market share.
Seasonal Inventory Management: Stock more popular products like Type B during peak seasons and holidays and optimize staffing and inventory based on seasonal trends.
Focus on Customer Retention: Develop loyalty programs targeting high-value customers and offer promotions tailored to weekday shoppers.
Leverage Predictive Analytics: Use sales forecasts to streamline operations, avoid overstocking, and reduce wastage.

**Conclusion**
This project highlights the key drivers of sales for Rossman stores and provides actionable insights to optimize marketing campaigns, inventory, and customer engagement strategies. By leveraging these findings, Rossman can enhance operational efficiency, boost customer satisfaction, and achieve sustained growth.
