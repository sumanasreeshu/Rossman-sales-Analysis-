# Rossmann Sales Forecasting and Business Strategy Optimization
**Project Overview**
This project aims to forecast sales and optimize business strategies for Rossmann, a leading European drug store chain with hundreds of stores. Using historical sales data, we developed predictive models and analyzed various factors affecting sales, such as promotions, holidays, and competition, to offer actionable insights for inventory and promotional strategy.

**Techniques and Models Used**
Data Mining and Analysis:

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Uncovered seasonal patterns, sales trends, and significant correlations within the data.
Feature Engineering: Created features for holiday effects, promotional periods, and rolling averages to improve model performance.
Forecasting Models:

**Time Series Models:** ARIMA and Prophet for traditional time series forecasting.

**Machine Learning Models:** Random Forest and XGBoost for robust predictive power.

**Deep Learning Models:** LSTM to capture sequential patterns in sales data.

**Evaluation Metrics:** The models were evaluated using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE).


**Impactful Results**

Predictive Power: The Random Forest model achieved a high R² score of 0.987, indicating it could explain approximately 98.7% of the variance in sales.
Promotions Analysis:
Standard Promotions (Promo) significantly increased sales, nearly doubling during promotion periods.
Extended Promotions (Promo2) had a less favorable impact, with sales slightly decreasing, suggesting potential consumer fatigue.
Store and Assortment Performance:
Store Types: Store Type 'b' had the highest average sales, indicating a high-performing category.
Assortments: Assortment 'b' outperformed others, reflecting strong customer preference for this product mix.
External Factors: Holidays and nearby competition had notable impacts on sales patterns, with certain holidays reducing sales and nearby competitors slightly impacting performance.


**Conclusion**
The analysis confirmed that Rossmann’s sales are influenced by a variety of factors, including store type, product assortment, promotions, and seasonality. The insights derived from this project support data-driven decision-making for inventory optimization, targeted promotions, and strategic adjustments across stores. The predictive models developed provide accurate sales forecasts, enabling Rossmann to make informed business strategy optimizations.
